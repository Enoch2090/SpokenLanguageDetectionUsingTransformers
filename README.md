Our work applies model modifications, transfer learning, parameter finetuning and experiments based on models from https://github.com/YuanGongND/ast and https://github.com/whai362/PVT/tree/v2/classification. The modified codes are saved in the two directories respectively. We keep the original license of each project as well as their original READMEs (but added citation to the original repo at the beginning), and removed some large files. The project as a whole will go under Apache 2.0 Licence but the AST part will retain as a BSD 3-Clause Licensed project.
